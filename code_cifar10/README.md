* To convert a given logging data into a tensor2tensor problem, run for example:
 sh off_policy_optimization/cifar/t2t/scripts/generate_all_datasets.sh

* For training the model:
 sh off_policy_optimization/cifar/t2t/scripts/launch_all.sh

* For evaluation:
 sh off_policy_optimization/cifar/t2t/scripts/eval_all.sh

The instructions above can be replicated for any variant of other previously
published blbf dataset and loss function/architecture combination by
uncommenting the appropriate lines in the scripts.
